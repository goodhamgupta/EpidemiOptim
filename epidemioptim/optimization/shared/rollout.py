    """
    Rollout function. Executes 'n' trajectories in 'env' using 'policy' with given 'goal'.

    Parameters
    ----------
    policy: BaseAlgorithm
        The algorithm whose policy is used as the agent.
    env: BaseEnv
        The learning environment.
    eval: bool
        Whether this is an evaluation episode (no exploration noise)
    n: int
        Number of episodes of interaction, default 1.
    additional_keys: tuple of strings, optional
        Additional elements from the info dict that should be collected and save in the episode dict, default ().
    goal: 2D nd.array, optional
        Goal vectors of dim (n, dim_goal) that the agent should target for each interaction.

    Returns
    -------
    list of dict
        List of 'n' episode summaries represented by dictionnaries containing informative metrics (states, actions, goals, etc).
